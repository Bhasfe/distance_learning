# Sentiment analysis on the tweets about distance learning withÂ TextBlob

## Introduction

The Covid19 Pandemic brought about distance learning in the 2020 academic term. Although some people could adapt easily, some of them found it inefficient. Nowadays, the re-opening of schools is being discussed. Most experts suggest that at least one semester should be online again. As a student who passed the last semester with distance learning, I could find a lot of time to spend on learning natural language processing. Finally, I decided to explore what people think about distance learning. We are going to explore the tweets related to distance learning to understand people's opinions (a.k.a opinion mining) and to discover facts. I have used the lexicon-based approach to determine the tweets' polarities. I have also build a machine learning model to predict the positivity and the negativity of the tweets.

I have collected **202.645** tweets related to distance learning by using Twitter API.
